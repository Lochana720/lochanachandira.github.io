# personal-portfolio

Personal portfolio website for **Sithmi Shehara**.

## What is included

- `index.html` — main page (responsive, dark-mode toggle, animations)
- `assets/style.css` — styles and color themes
- `assets/script.js` — theme toggle + dummy contact form
- `assets/profile.svg` and `assets/project-placeholder.svg` — simple vector placeholders
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.
2. Replace `assets/profile.svg` with your photo (use filename `assets/profile.jpg` or update `index.html`).
3. Customize text (name, bio, projects).
4. To publish on GitHub Pages:
   - Create a new GitHub repository.
   - Push all files to the `main` branch.
   - In repository Settings -> Pages, select `main` branch and `/ (root)`.
   - Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/personal-portfolio/`.

## Notes

- The contact form is a dummy client-side form — it shows a success message but does not send messages. You can connect EmailJS or a backend later.
- Theme preference is saved in `localStorage`.
